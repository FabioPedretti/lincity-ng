Schools

Schools use jobs and goods to produce technology in a similar way to universities.
They use far fewer jobs and goods than universities, but produce far fewer tech points.
Given the choice between putting four or five schools in a given area, or a single university,
it is often (but not always) better to put a university in.

Schools do not need to connect to transport, but do need to be within
range of a market than can supply the quantity of jobs and goods to make the school work.

Schools cost money to run. You can see the total cost for the last year by clicking on the money button.
