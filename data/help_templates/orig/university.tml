University

Universities help to increase your technology level.
In the process they consume goods and labor. They produce more than schools for a given goods/labor input.
However they consume a lot of goods and labor and also cost quite a lot of money to run, so you should
have the economic and industrial capacity to supply them.

You will need a number of universities to achieve a tech level close to 100%

Universities do not need to be connected to transport; they can get all their
requirements from markets within range and with enough labor and goods available.

SUBH: NOTE

You must have 4 schools per university to supply them with students.

250 labor + 750 goods =&gt; .0004 tech + 250 waste

A university can sustain up to ~20 tech <100 or ~10 tech >100
