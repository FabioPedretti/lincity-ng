Farms

Farms grow food for people to eat, and to supply the raw materials for mills.

Production of farm depends on underground water. Tiles with water are green, others are yellow-brown (like desert or bare ground).

Farms need jobs to produce more than a minimal amount of food. Providing elecricity (lo-volt) boosts the output. Powered farms can irregate dry soil and also consume wastes. Beware of agricultural water consumption.

SUBH: Formulas

13 jobs + 50 lo-volt =&gt; 550 food + 5.5 food * tech

13 jobs =&gt; 132 food

If a farm has less than 100% fertility, then it will produce proportionally less food.
A powered farm can compensate for lack of fertility by consuming 50 water per desert tile.

Unlike most other constructions, a farm scales the formulas proportionally when they cannot be fully applied.
