Fire stations

Fire stations prevent the start and spread of fire within
the range that they cover. They need to be supplied with goods and jobs
to work. They also cost money to run.

When you build a fire station, it does not start straight away.
There is usually a three month wait before fire cover is provided.

To see the area that your fire stations cover, click on the
fire station button under the mini screen.

Fire stations increase the desirability of residential
areas within their range.

Fire stations go through an animation sequence
every three month to show that they are working.
