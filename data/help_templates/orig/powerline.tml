Power lines

Power lines carry power from solar and coal
power stations and modern windmills to substations or industrial areas.

Power lines cross under tracks, roads, railways and rivers (all of the width of 1).
If a power line is placed on either side of a transport or river area,
they act as if they are joined. Often you will have to bulldoze a bit
of river to cross a river - it's expensive! The power lines are joined when they are aligned and
power packtes hop from one side to another
