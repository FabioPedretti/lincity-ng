*** Lincity NG 2.11.0 ***

Fixes since 2.10.2:
* Fixed portability for Windows.
* Fixed failure to load sound effects.
* Fixed error displaying school and university help pages.
* Fixed "Invalid ExtraFrames" warning caused by waste fires.
* Fixed warning re. excessive goods production by mills.
* Fixed missing git describe in package versions that are generated with CPack.
* Removed extraneous link libraries.
* Fixed handling of window size in fullscreen mode.
* Fixed some typos.

Additions since 2.10.2:
* Added support for cross-compiling from Linux to Windows with MinGW-w64. (Now
  Windows binaries can be included in the release.)
* Made in-game windows and dialogs resizable by dragging the edges/corners.
* Added production/consumption formulas for each module to help pages.
* Added error checking for loading sound effects.
* Added Include What You Use as a build step, and cleaned up includes.

Changes since 2.10.2:
* Renamed MWh and kWh commodities to "high-voltage power" and
  "low-voltage power" respectively with short names "hi-volt" and "lo-volt".
* Renamed "jobs" commodity to "labor".
* Improved handling of waste fires, so they are less bug prone.
* Refactored lintypes.cpp/hpp and moved some symbols to other files.
* Switched internal libraries from object to static type.
* Cleaned up target link libraries.

Removals since 2.10.2:
* Removed messages.pot generation from normal build. This removes the gettest
  build dependency except for translators. Translators must now generate the
  messages.pot file with a separate build step.

Regressions since 2.10.2:
* Some translations may be outdated since renaming commodities.
* Production/Consumption formulas do not exist in translated help pages.

*** Lincity NG 2.10.0 *** [git: f03cbe1] 2024-03-08

Updates to Gameplay since 2.9.0:
* The amount of swing jobs created by health cover has been corrected. You may
  find that you need fewer residences and/or more jobs demand in your economy.
* Jobs production at residences scales down as inventory increases. This should
  make employment feel more stable and make it easier to strike a balance in
  employment. The amount of the production decrease is dependent on "swing"
  jobs, so sports cover and health cover increase the effect. The previous
  method using a "swingometer" has been abandoned.
* Evacuation logic is modified slightly to avoid a construction getting negative
  inventory.
* Added water to the market trade dialog.

Bug fixes since 2.9.0:
* Fixed jumpy and laggy scrolling near the map edge.
* Fixed a bug where the shift key (used to increase scroll speed) was
  "forgotten" when hitting the map edge.
* Fixed a bug where moving the cursor outside the game window may cause the map
  to scroll.
* Fixed a buffer overflow when the home directory path name is very long.
* Fixed a bug where health cover did not create the correct amount of swing
  jobs.
* Fixed a bug where evacuation could cause a construction to have negative
  inventory.
* Fixed a bug in load/save where parks could erroneously get very high
  inventory.
* Fixed the speed and direction of scrolling with the scroll wheel in help
  pages.
* Fixed a bug where building the project could overwrite changes to GUI dialogs.

Updates to controls since 2.9.0:
* Panning (i.e. scrolling by dragging) is done with the middle mouse button
  instead of the right button.
* Panning (i.e. scrolling by dragging) makes the map move in the expected
  direction.
* Added map scrolling with WASD.
* Zooming is done relative to the cursor position instead of the center of the
  screen. This makes map navigation much more natural. And it plays nice with
  hitting the map edge (which is more complex then you may first expect).
* Scrolling speed is normalized for direction and zoom level. (So scrolling
  diagonally while zoomed in no longer feels like mach 3.)
* Right click shows information about construction or tile.
* G key toggles the right-click function, i.e. construction info or tile info.

Updates to presentation since 2.9.0:
* Improved simulation performance. (Fast speed is now blazing fast.)
* Decoupled the speeds of simulation, animation, screen redrawing, and GUI so
  animation and frame rate is no longer dependent on simulation speed. This
  makes the UI much smoother at slow simulation speed.
* Added a page to the MPS display for most constructions that shows monthly
  production/consumption of commodities (both as absolute and percentage).
* Tweaked the total inventory MPS page so that the red/green bars are faster to
  reflect changes in production.
* The minimap position is constrained to avoid showing space outside the map.
* Panning (i.e. scrolling by dragging) changes the cursor appearance
  appropriately.
* Created a (much prettier IMO) black background for the map.

Invisible updates since 2.9.0:
* Changed the location of save games from ~/.lincity-ng to
  ~/.local/share/lincity-ng. For now, existing save games from the old location
  are still loaded, but subsequent saves go to the new location.
* Replaced the outdated autoconf and Jam build tools with CMake. (Be sure to
  follow the updated instructions for building the project.)
* Use GNU directory structure for installed files.
* Use CPack for creating release packages.
* Use Docker to help create compatible binaries for Ubuntu. (Now we can release
  binary packages.)
* Install an icon and a desktop file to proper locations for Linux systems.
* Added a hook in the build system to append the current git hash to the version
  number when not on a release version. This should help reduce ambiguity in bug
  reports.
* Upgraded the MPS display API so constructions can have any number of pages.
* Removed uses of deprecated PhysFS features.
* Cleaned up the logic for binary relocation (and probably fixed a few things).
* Fixed errors and warnings when compiling with C++20.
* Fixed warnings when compiling with -Wall option.
* Added a construction initialization stage to loading and building
  constructions.
* Tidied up the source tree and deleted dead code.

Updates to documentation and translation since 2.9.0:
* Converted the readme to GitHub Markdown.
* Expanded the dependency list in the readme to include build dependencies.
* Include commands for installing dependencies on Ubuntu in the readme.
* Removed dead links in the readme.
* Added gd translation for desktop file.
* Generates translation files during build.
* Updated the list of editors in translation instructions.
* Updated formatting in COPYING file.

Regressions / known bugs since 2.9.0:
* Untested on Windows and Mac.
* Infrastructure for building for Mac may be missing since updating the build
  tool.
* Ports are OP.
* Does not autodetect screen size on startup in fullscreen.
